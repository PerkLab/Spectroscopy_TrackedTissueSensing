# Broadband optical spectroscopy and machine learning for tissue classification
### // TODO // 
- Create a much more informative read me.
- Split my code into the various processing steps rather than having everything in one document

### // Summary //
This repo is where all of the code is stored for the Broadband Optical Spectroscopy will be stored including preprocessing, algorithms, and slicer modules.

The overall goal of this project is to create a protype for a system which uses a tracked optical probe and a broadband lightsource to intraoperatively detect tissue types via a machine learning classifier.
