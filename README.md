# Broadband optical spectroscopy and machine learning for tissue classification
### // TODO // 
- Create a much more informative read me.
- Split my code into the various processing steps rather than having everything in one document

### // Summary //
This repo is where all of the code is stored for the Broadband Optical Spectroscopy will be stored including preprocessing, algorithms, and slicer modules.

The overall goal of this project is to create a prototype for a system which uses a tracked optical probe and a broadband lightsource to intraoperatively detect tissue types via a machine learning classifier.

The approach is to create a 3D slicer module to interface with the devices in real time, integrate a trained classifier, and produce a GUI to effectively display the informations.
