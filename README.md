# Broadband optical spectroscopy and machine learning for tissue classification
### // TODO // 
- Create a much more informative read me.
- Split my code into the various processing steps rather than having everything in one document

### // Summary //
This repo is where all of the code is stored for the Broadband Optical Spectroscopy including preprocessing, algorithms, and slicer modules.

The overall goal of this project is to create a prototype for a system which uses a tracked optical probe and a broadband lightsource to intraoperatively detect tissue types via a machine learning classifier.

The approach is to create a 3D slicer module to interface with the devices in real time, integrate a trained classifier, and produce a GUI to effectively display the informations.
