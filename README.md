# Navigated tissue sensing module: Broadband optical spectroscopy, electromagnetic tracking, and machine learning for tissue classification

### Summary
This repo is where all of the code is stored for the Broadband Optical Spectroscopy including preprocessing, algorithms, and slicer modules.

The overall goal of this project is to create a prototype for a system which uses a tracked optical probe and a broadband lightsource to intraoperatively detect tissue types via a machine learning classifier.

The approach is to create a 3D slicer module to interface with the devices in real time, integrate a trained classifier, and produce a GUI to effectively display the informations.
